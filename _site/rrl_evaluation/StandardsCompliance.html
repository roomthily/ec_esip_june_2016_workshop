<td>Standards compliance, but incomplete and untested. The software and software development process attempt to comply with recognized standards, but without verification. Standards compliance is thus untested and may not be complete.</td>

The software and software development process comply with internationally recognized standards such as W3C, XML, XHTML, WAI, IP for Web; or ANSI/ISO (C/C++), JCP (Java), for software; and CMMI, IEEE Software Engineering Standards for development process. Standards compliance has been verified through testing, but not by an independent testing organization.</td>
